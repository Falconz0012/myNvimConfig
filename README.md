<h1> My Nvim Config </h1>

<h2>Why Nvim?</h2>
<p> Nvim is highly customizable and allows me to build a text editor crafted to my needs, not bloated nor slow, only the features i feel are necessary are embedded in my config, it's just like the feeling of wearing a nicely taylored suit that fits you better than it would anyone else, cruising through files and editing text becomes a joy when your vehicle to do so is something you care deeply about. </p>


<h2>Knowing your tools will also make you inherintly more productive</h2>
<h3><b><i>"IF YOU KNOW YOURSELF AND KNOW YOUR ENEMY YOU NEED NOT FEAR THE RESULT OF A HUNDRED BATTLES"</i></b></h3>


<p1>This project will be a WIP forever probably, more often than not my necessities change over time and my config will follow me along, learning Vim (Nvim) is just fun and understanding plug-ins while being able to integrate them into my dev environment is a process i will surely keep going at. </p1>
